# Printing Numbers example
# print(2)

# # As well as whole numbers you can print decmials
# print(2.098)

# # Printing negative numbers
# print(-2)

# # Printing Addition/Subtraction/Multiplication Sums
# print(3+4)
# print(3*4)
# print(3/4)

# # Order of Operation
# print(3*4(3+4))

# # Modulas Operator
# print(10 % 3)

# # storing in Variables
# my_num = 5
# print(my_num)

# Converting Numbers to Strings
# my_num = -5
# print(str(my_num))

# You can also convert Numbers to Strings by using a comma to add a Number to a String in a print() function
# print(my_num, "string")

# Common Number Function-----------------

# Return the absolute value with abs() function
# my_num = -5
# print('This is the absolute function returning the absolute value of the parsed Number, which is:', abs(my_num))


# To the power of, with pow() function
# val_one = 3
# val_two = 2
# print('')
# print('Return the equation of',"'",val_one,"'",'to the power of',"'",val_two,"'",', which is: ', pow(val_one, val_two))


# Compare Numbers with max() and min()
# new_num = 4
# orig_num = 10

# print('\nComparing',new_num,'to',orig_num,'This code will output the highest number, which is:',max(new_num, orig_num))
# time.sleep(1.2)
# print('\nComparing',new_num,'to',orig_num,'This code will output the lowest number, which is:',min(new_num, orig_num),'\n')


# Rounding Numbers with round()
# a_num = 27.7

# print('\nRounding this number ->',a_num,'to the nearest whole number example. Here is the returned result of the round() function:',round(a_num),'\n')



# example of importing modules
# from math import *


# # floor() method - rounds the number down
# numbr = 5.7
# print(floor(numbr))

# # ciel() method - rounds the number up
# numbr = 5.7
# print(ceil(numbr))

# # Square Root sqrt() method - returns the square root of a number
# numbr = 36
# print(sqrt(numbr))
